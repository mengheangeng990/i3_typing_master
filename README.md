## Setup Instructions  

### Prerequisites  
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari)  
- Optional: A simple HTTP server (e.g., VSCode Live Server, Python HTTP server) for better local testing  

### How to Run Locally  
1. Clone or download the project folder to your local machine.  
2. Open the folder in your code editor or file explorer.  
3. To run directly:  
   - Open `index.html` in your browser.  
   - Note: Some features like localStorage work best when served via a local server.  

4. To use a local server (recommended):  
   - If you have Python installed, open a terminal in the project folder and run:  
     - For Python 3: `python3 -m http.server 8000`  
     - For Python 2: `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000`  
   - Then open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.  

### Testing the Application  
- Navigate through pages via the navigation bar.  
- Register a new user, log in, and try the typing test.  
- After submitting a typing test, results are saved locally and can be viewed on the dashboard.  
- Use the password reset page to test email input functionality (no backend, just demo alert).  

## Technologies Used  
- HTML5  
- CSS3 (inline and internal styling)  
- JavaScript (vanilla JS for form handling and localStorage)  

## Notes  
- The project uses `localStorage` to save test results locally.  
- No backend server or database is included; all functionality runs client-side.  
- Password reset is a demo with no actual email sending.
